        <p class="mb-4">
          A changemaker is someone who actively seeks to effect positive and sustainable change within themselves, their local community, an organization, the wider society, or globally. This journey towards change is inherently a collective, creative endeavor, rooted in collaboration.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
         Changemakers draw upon their unique blend of talents, skills, knowledge, and resources, transcending traditional job roles. For this reason, we refer to 'roles' rather than positions or titles. In the context of our work, we've identified twenty-two critical roles that are pivotal in the process of changemaking. 
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
           Each individual naturally aligns with certain roles over others because these roles give them energy. By engaging with the Changemaker Assessment truthfully, individuals can shine a light on the roles they naturally embody, as well as those that are less innate to them. This insight is invaluable, guiding each changemaker towards areas where their contributions can be most impactful.
        <p class="mb-4">
           

        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2 mt-4">DIRECTIONS</h2>
 <p class="mb-4">
The <b> Six-Point Scale for Changemaking Roles</b> is designed to help you evaluate how closely various change-making roles and activities align with your natural abilities and personal sense of purpose. By reflecting on how each statement resonates with you, you can gain insights into where you might focus your energy and development to become a more effective and fulfilled changemaker.
     </p>
   <p class="mb-4">
     <b>Step 1. Center in Purpose:</b> Before you proceed with the next section of this quiz, take a moment to center yourself in the sense of purpose that drives you as a changemaker. Reflect on the passions, values, and motivations that inspire you to make a difference, allowing them to guide your responses and illuminate your path forward.
      </p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">
    

         <p class="mb-4">
   <b> Step 2. Commit to Self-honesty:</b> Even in our private moments, we can feel pressure to be "good" at everything. Consider giving yourself permission to be honest and even vulnerable in your responses. This will help identify the changemaker roles that resonate most with your natural strengths and provide that innate source of energy that helps you thrive as a changemaker. 
            </p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">
 <b>Step 3. Rate Each Item:</b> This six-point scale is designed to help you evaluate how closely various change-making roles and activities align with your natural abilities and personal sense of purpose. You will be asked to read eighty-eight statements the describe a skill or activity. You will then be asked to rate which of the statements below best reflects your relationship to that skill or activity. Collectively, your responses to these statements will illuminate which changemaker roles come most naturally and give you the most energy.
   </p>


      <p class="mb-4 ml-4">
               <b>1: Highly Challenging and Misaligned:</b> This activity or role feels distinctly out of sync with my core values and purpose. It presents significant challenges, requiring effort in areas that do not naturally engage or inspire me. <br>
<b>2: Moderately Misaligned but Manageable:</b> There's a slight connection to my interests or skills, yet it doesn't deeply resonate with or effectively advance my purpose. While manageable, it demands effort in ways that feel less fulfilling.<br>
<b>3: Neutral Alignment and Competence:</b> This represents a middle ground where elements of the role align with my purpose, and I possess the necessary skills to be competent. It's a mix of fit and challenge, with neither strong dissonance nor passionate resonance.<br>
<b>4: Moderately Aligned and Naturally Effective:</b> I find a meaningful connection with this activity or role that aligns well with my purpose. It leverages my strengths and comes to me with a degree of natural ease, making me effective and engaged.<br>
<b>5: Highly Aligned and Effortlessly Natural:</b> This activity or role is a perfect match, deeply resonating with my values and purpose. It feels effortlessly natural, allowing me to excel and derive profound fulfillment from my involvement.<br>
