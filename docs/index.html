        <p>
          A changemaker is someone who actively seeks to effect positive and sustainable change within themselves, their local community, an organization, the wider society, or globally. This journey towards change is inherently a collective, creative endeavor, rooted in collaboration.
        </p>

         <p>
         Changemakers draw upon their unique blend of talents, skills, knowledge, and resources, transcending traditional job roles. For this reason, we refer to 'roles' rather than positions or titles. In the context of our work, we've identified twenty-two critical roles that are pivotal in the process of changemaking. 
        </p>

         <p>
           Each individual naturally aligns with certain roles over others because these roles give them energy. By engaging with the Changemaker Assessment truthfully, individuals can shine a light on the roles they naturally embody, as well as those that are less innate to them. This insight is invaluable, guiding each changemaker towards areas where their contributions can be most impactful.
         <p>
           

        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2 mt-4">DIRECTIONS</h2>

        <p>
          Rate Each Item: For each statement or activity listed in the quiz, consider how it typically affects your energy level. Use the 6-point scale where:
        <p>

      <p>
                6 = Strongly Gives Energy: Significantly increases your energy and motivation.
                5 = Moderately Gives Energy: Noticeably boosts your energy, but less so than the strongest energizers.
                4 = Slightly Gives Energy: Has a mild, positive effect on your energy.
                3 = Slightly Drains Energy: Causes a small decrease in your energy levels.
                2 = Moderately Drains Energy: Noticeably reduces your energy and enthusiasm.
                1 = Strongly Drains Energy: Significantly depletes your energy, leaving you feeling very tired or overwhelmed.
       <p>

        <p>
    Be Reflective: Carefully answer each question to best reflect your personal experiences and inclinations. Your honest responses will help identify the changemaker roles that resonate most with your natural strengths and provide that innate source of energy that helps you thrive as a changemaker. 
       <p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2 mt-4">Instructions:</h2>
        <ol class="list-decimal ml-4">
          <li>
            Read Carefully: Begin by reading each role's description to understand its significance and
            characteristics.
          </li>
          <li>
            Assess Honestly: For each statement, reflect on how well it resonates with your experiences, beliefs, and
            behaviors.
          </li>
          <li>
            3. Choose Your Response: Select the response that best represents your level of agreement with each
            statement.

          </li>
          <li>
            No Right or Wrong Answers: There are no correct or incorrect responses. This assessment is about your
