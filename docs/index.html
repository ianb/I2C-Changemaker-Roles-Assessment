        <p class="mb-4">
          A changemaker is someone who actively seeks to effect positive and sustainable change within themselves, their local community, an organization, the wider society, or globally. This journey towards change is inherently a collective, creative endeavor, rooted in collaboration.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
         Changemakers draw upon their unique blend of talents, skills, knowledge, and resources, transcending traditional job roles. For this reason, we refer to 'roles' rather than positions or titles. In the context of our work, we've identified twenty-two critical roles that are pivotal in the process of changemaking. 
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
           Each individual naturally aligns with certain roles over others because these roles give them energy. By engaging with the Changemaker Assessment truthfully, individuals can shine a light on the roles they naturally embody, as well as those that are less innate to them. This insight is invaluable, guiding each changemaker towards areas where their contributions can be most impactful.
        <p class="mb-4">
           

        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2 mt-4">DIRECTIONS</h2>

   <p class="mb-4">
     Center in Purpose: Before you proceed with the next section of this quiz, take a moment to center yourself in the sense of purpose that drives you as a changemaker. Reflect on the passions, values, and motivations that inspire you to make a difference, allowing them to guide your responses and illuminate your path forward.
      </p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">
     Rate Each Item: This six-point scale is designed to help you evaluate how closely various change-making roles and activities align with your natural abilities and personal sense of purpose. By reflecting on how each statement resonates with you, you can gain insights into where you might focus your energy and development to become a more effective and fulfilled changemaker.
   </p>


      <p class="mb-4 ml-4">

                Slightly Agree: This activity or role somewhat comes naturally to me and somewhat aligns with my sense of purpose.

                Strongly Agree: This activity or role completely resonates with my natural abilities and perfectly aligns with my sense of purpose.


         <p class="mb-4">

        <p>
